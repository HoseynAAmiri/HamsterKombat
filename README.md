# HamsterKombat
A dash app that helps devise strategy for your upgrades!

https://hamsterkombat.io/

Get the current status of all your cards and enter them in the csv file. Then open the app (`hamster.py`) and it sorts the upgrades based on the priority. The interactive table allows you to also sort based on different criteria. Don't worry if you update a card. Just modify the table (level, PPHs, etc.) using `int` values (!) and click on "Save Changes". It will replace your csv file with the new data. Do not refresh the browser!! If you did, just run the `hamster.py` again.
